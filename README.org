* Notes
Oz was tried on day 8 and 9 but wasn't suited/I wasn't good enough with it to use it on that problem, so it was replaced by a(n ugly/rushed) python solution instead. Common Lisp took its place the 9th.
Octave was attempted on the 9th.
Oz took over Carp's entry on the 11th.

Remember to write a little note on which languages
